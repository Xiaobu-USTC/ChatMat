Question: What is the energy and force of Al176Si24?
Thought: I need to find the energy of CH4.
Action: Search_csv
Action Input: "Search name Al176Si24 and provide information on energy"
Observation: The energy of material "Al176Si24" is 0.0202 eV. Check to see if this answer can be you final answer, and if so, you should submit your final answer.
Thought: The search_csv tool provided the energy of CH4, but not the force. I need to find the force.
Action: Search_csv
Action Input: "Search name Al176Si24 and provide information on force"
Observation: The Search_csv tool did not provide any information on the force of Al176Si24. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
Thought: The search_csv tool provided the energy of Al176Si24, but not the force. I need to find the force.
Action: Predictor
Action Input: "Predict theforce of Al176Si24"
Observation: The energy and force of CH4 is 0.0202 eV and 0.0101 eV/Å. Check to see if this answer can be your final answer, and if so, you should submit your final answer.
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The energy and force of CH4 is 0.0202 eV and 0.0101 eV/Å.
